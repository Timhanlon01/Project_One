# MLB Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes MLB data using Python, combining hitter statistics and MLB ELO ratings. It calculates OPS, compares league performances, and visualizes the relationship between OPS and Runs.

## Dependencies
- Python 
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Data Sources
- `Hitters.csv`: MLB hitter statistics
- `mlb_elo_latest.csv`: MLB ELO ratings

## Features
- Data loading and combination
- OPS calculation (OBP, SLG, and OPS)
- Statistical analysis (average OPS by league, correlation between OPS and Runs)
- Data visualization (bar chart and scatter plot)

## Usage
This script does the following:
1. Shows what's in the datasets
2. Figures out OPS averages for each league and how they relate to Runs
3. Makes a table showing OPS and Runs for different Leagues and Divisions
4. Creates two pictures:
    - A bar chart showing average OPS for each league
    - A scatter plot showing how OPS and Runs are connected

## Output
- On screen: Summaries of the data and key numbers
- Pictures: Two graphs made with matplotlib

## Conclusion
- What I learned from this project is how to use Kaggle, adding CSV files, combining datasets using Pandas, calculating data and creating a pivot table and lastly using matplotlib to create a bar graph and a scatter plot
- The answer to my question, does OPS influence Runs? Yes, if you have a higher OPS you tend to have more runs too
