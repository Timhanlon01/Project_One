# MLB Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes MLB data using Python, combining hitter statistics and MLB ELO ratings. It calculates OPS, compares league performances, and visualizes the relationship between OPS and Runs.

## Dependencies
- Python 
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Data Sources
- `Hitters.csv`: MLB hitter statistics
- `mlb_elo_latest.csv`: MLB ELO ratings

## Features
- Data loading and combination
- OPS calculation (OBP, SLG, and OPS)
- Statistical analysis (average OPS by league, correlation between OPS and Runs)
- Data visualization (bar chart and scatter plot)

## Usage
This script does the following:
1. Shows what's in the datasets
2. Figures out OPS averages for each league and how they relate to Runs
3. Table showing OPS and Runs for different Leagues and Divisions
4. Created two pictures:
    - A bar chart showing average OPS for each league
    - A scatter plot showing how OPS and Runs are connected

## Output
- On screen: Summaries of the data and key numbers
- Pictures: Two graphs made with matplotlib

## Conclusion
- What I learned from this project is how to use Kaggle, adding CSV files, combining datasets using Pandas, calculating data and creating a pivot table and lastly using matplotlib to create a bar graph and a scatter plot
- A problem I had was trying to find true data
- The answer to my question, does OPS influence Runs? Yes, if you have a higher OPS you tend to have more runs too
